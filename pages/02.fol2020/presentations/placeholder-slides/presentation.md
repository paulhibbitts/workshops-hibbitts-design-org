# Markdown + Git üëâ Support of the 5Rs of OER

1. Retain - make, own, and control a copy of the resource (e.g., download and keep your own copy)
1. Revise - edit, adapt, and modify your copy of the resource (e.g., translate into another language)
1. Remix - combine your original or revised copy of the resource with other existing material to create something new (e.g., make a mashup)
1. Reuse - use your original, revised, or remixed copy of the resource publicly (e.g., on a website, in a presentation, in a class)
1. Redistribute - share copies of your original, revised, or remixed copy of the resource with others (e.g., post a copy online or give one to a friend)
